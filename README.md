# GKseq2
This script allows to plot the coverage of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ re-sequencing data mapped to the TAIR10 reference genome sequence. The input is a TAB-separated coverage (COV) file, which has three columns (sequenceID, position, coverage).

## Usage

## Reference
This script is based on a previously developed Python2 script (https://github.com/bpucker/GKseq), which was developed for the analysis of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ re-sequencing data (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07877-8).
